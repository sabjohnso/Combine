- Combine :: A harvesting maching that heads, threshes, and cleans
             grain while moving over a fields
             (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/combine).

* Brief Description
  This is a header library with common functionality harvested from
  other projects.  There are a number of tests that can be built and
  executed but otherwise not binaries need to be compiled.  The
  library relies on the C++11 standard and is therefore only portable
  to compilers that implement the C++11 standard.  The functionality
  includes, but is not limited to
  - application drivers
  - exception handling
  - template meta-programming tools
  - static_assertions
  - debugging tools

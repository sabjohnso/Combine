* Brief Description

  This is a header library with common functionality harvested from my other projects, insightful blogs I encountered, other open source projects and interesting stack exchanges. There are a number of tests that can be built and executed but otherwise, no binaries need to be compiled.  The library relies on the C++11 standard and is therefore only portable to compilers that implement the C++11 standard.

* Functionality Overview
  - Partial function application
  - Folds
  - Generic constructors

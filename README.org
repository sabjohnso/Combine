#+TITLE:Combine -- A harvested library 

- Combine :: A harvesting maching that heads, threshes, and cleans
             grain while moving over a field
             (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/combine).

* Brief Description

  This is a header library with common functionality harvested from
  my other projects, insightful blogs I encountered [fn:multiparadigm],
  other open source projects and interesting stack exchanges. There
  are a number of tests that can be built and executed but otherwise,
  no binaries need to be compiled.  The library relies on the C++11
  standard and is therefore  only portable to compilers that implement
  the C++11 standard. 

* Functionality Overview
  - Partial function application
  - Folds
  - Generic constructors
